## Installing OWASP zaproxy and use it

    $ sudo apt-get install zaproxy
    $ zaproxy

On inital startup got an error that port 8080 was already in use, simply accepted to use the proposed port 8081 ( you can also choose different port on GUI)

Next generated CA-certificate ( tools -> options -> Networl -> Server Certificates -> Generate ) and  saved it to my VM. Next configured firefox to use the generated certificate ( certificate manager -> import and selected the imported certificate. )

After i had setted up the certificate, started firefox and verified i could capture traffic with zap.

## intercepting and editing request

Disconnected kali from internet. Started metasploitable2 and tried pinging it from kali succesfully.

On zap i selected 'Set break on all requests and responses' to be able to see to requests made before sending them further. Then filled out the registeration form at browser and submitted it.

Changed some details from the intercepted request and released it from zap 'Submit and continue to next breakpoint'.

Eventhough new acount was not succesfully registered with the changed data the modified data was actually sent forward.

## Webgoat HTTP basics and Developer tools

I already had zap at port 8081 and webgoat at 8080, so no conflict there.

The first spot simply reversed the entered text

The POST method is the correct answer for the first one, since POST request is used to send data to server vs GET to retrieve data. ( common knowledge ). To get the magic number, simply clicked the right button and chose inspect. Then searched for 'magic' and got the number. Lastly submitted the anserw and got verification that it was the correct one.
