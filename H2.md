## Installing OWASP zaproxy and use it

    $ sudo apt-get install zaproxy
    $ zaproxy

On inital startup got an error that port 8080 was already in use, simply accepted to use the proposed port 8081 ( you can also choose different port on GUI)

Next generated CA-certificate ( tools -> options -> Networl -> Server Certificates -> Generate ) and  saved it to my VM. Next configured firefox to use the generated certificate ( certificate manager -> import and selected the imported certificate. )

After i had setted up the certificate, started firefox and verified i could capture traffic with zap.

## intercepting and editing request

Disconnected kali from internet. Started metasploitable2 and tried pinging it from kali succesfully.

On zap i selected 'Set break on all requests and responses' to be able to see to requests made before sending them further. Then filled out the registeration form at browser and submitted it.

Changed some details from the intercepted request and released it from zap 'Submit and continue to next breakpoint'.

Eventhough new acount was not succesfully registered with the changed data the modified data was actually sent forward.

## Webgoat HTTP basics and Developer tools

I already had zap at port 8081 and webgoat at 8080, so no conflict there.

The first spot simply reversed the entered text

![basics](https://github.com/t-t-r/Penetration-testing-course-2023/blob/main/img/inspect.jpg)

The POST method is the correct answer for the first one, since POST request is used to send data to server vs GET to retrieve data. ( common knowledge ). To get the magic number, simply clicked the right button and chose inspect. Then searched for 'magic' and got the number. Lastly submitted the anserw and got verification that it was the correct one.

![console](https://github.com/t-t-r/Penetration-testing-course-2023/blob/main/img/console.jpg)

Next tried the console ( right click -> inspect -> console ) and called the webgoat.customjs.phoneHome() function in it.
Picked up the phonenumber, and submitted the answer.

![network](https://github.com/t-t-r/Penetration-testing-course-2023/blob/main/img/network.jpg)

Next i needed to find a spesific field on a HTTP request. First generated the request and opened network-tab at developer tools and simply searched with 'network' scrolled down and found the number.

(no sources - simply try, fail, try until succeeded )

## SQLzoo.net

Task was to do some simple SQL. These were pretty self explanatory, so no further comments needed here.

### Broken autenthication

Spend a lot of time on this one. Had problems capturing/proxying traffic from localhost. Eventually got it by installing foxy proxy add-on.
Rest was easy. First submitted the form, added break point from zap. Then reloaded, submitted again. First tried to remove the
