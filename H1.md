# Installing Kali on VirtualBox

1. At first dowmloaded prebuild Kali image from kali.org ( https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines ).
2. opened virtualbox (VB) and added the downloaded kali .vbox file.
3. logged in with username: kali and password: kali
4. Went to cmd line and changed the preset password. 
5. Changed keyboard layout to finnish.


That does it. Only suprise was the downloaded file was seemingly large with 2,7GB size.


# Installing and setting up metasploitable2

1. Downloaded metasploitable2 from sourceforge ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ )
2. Opened VB, clicked 'new'
3. Named my new VM to be 'metasploitable' and selected type: linux version: Other Linux (64bit)
4. When opted to select Virtual Hard disk, i chose to use the prev. downloaded vmdf file Metasploitable.vmdk ( Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File ).
5. When attempting to start up i got KERNEL PANIC, fixed this by setting pu two processors for my VM ( at settings -> system -> processors )

# creating a virtual network where kali can connect/disconnect from internet

1. tried pinging from the command line and used browser to access iltalehti.fi webpage
2. both tests confiremed that i had internet connection
3. Disconnected network adapter 1 from network settings and ran the test again
4. Both tests confirmed that i was no longer connected to internet

[Connection no connection](/pingtest%20pass%26fail.jpg?raw=true "Testing connection")

Next made sure that there was no internet connection on metasploit with the same ping test from metasploit -> no connection
    
    $ifconfig

cheked the ip address of metasploit with iconfig, and then pinged the metasploit ip from kali and after a couple of failed attemps connected the network adapter on metasploit.

# Finding metasploitable with portscanning

Started metasploit. 

    $kali sudo msfdb run

Metsploit first created a db for the program and started metasploits cmd prompt.
First created myself a workspace, named it h1. Then switched using h1-workspace.

    msf6 > workspace - a h1 ( -a adds a workplace )
    msf6 > workspace h1 ( selects the workspace )
    msf6 > workspace ( cheked the current workspace in use -> asterix+red )
    msf6 > db_nmap -sn 192.168.56.1-255
    msf6 > hosts

The db part of command stores the scan result in database and -sn means ping scan ( source: man nmap )
From the scan result picked up the ip and connected to it via browser

# Scanning metaploitable in detail

    msf6 > db_nmap -A 192.168.56.102

The -A gives a much more detailed result. After scanning cheked the data stored.

# breaking into metasploitable

I had the scan results stored in my db and browsed through them.
