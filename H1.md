# Asenna kali virtuaalikoneeseen

1. At first dowmloaded prebuild kali image from kali.org ( https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines )
2. opened virtualbox and added the downloaded kali .vbox file
3. logged in with username 'kali' and password 'kali'
4. Went to cmd line and changed the preset password 

That does it. Only suprise was the downloaded file was seemingly large with 2,7GB size.
