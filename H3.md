To solve this, i first tried '-- at the end of the search and noticed that i got more products. The -- ignoress the rest of the query as a comment. Next added to query and solved the excercise. Really didn't need the zaproxy to solve this one.

## HTB

Downloaded openVPN file from HTB, followed instructions from https://terokarvinen.com/2023/tunkeutumistestaus-2023-kevat/#h3-the-box to set up the VPN connection and tested that connection to internet was down. 

( Could not get all other traffic blocked, have to be extra careful )
