To solve this, i first tried '-- at the end of the search and noticed that i got more products. The -- ignoress the rest of the query as a comment. Next added to query and solved the excercise. Really didn't need the zaproxy to solve this one.

## HTB

Downloaded openVPN file from HTB, followed instructions from https://terokarvinen.com/2023/tunkeutumistestaus-2023-kevat/#h3-the-box to set up the VPN connection and tested that connection to internet was down. 

( Could not get all other traffic blocked, have to be extra careful )

After i had the coonection set up, i simply hit 'spawn machine' to and got the target 10.129.88.112. Verified that i really could connect to it by pinging the ip.


First i had to anserw to some trivial questions at HTB:

What does the acronym VM stand for? Answer: Virtual Machine
...It's also known as a console or shell.  Answer: terminal
What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs? Answer: openvpn
What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the output of your VPN boot-up sequence output? Answer: tun
What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request? Answer: ping
What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target? Answer: nmap
What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans? Answer: telnet ( $nmap ip -> got the answer )
What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password? Answer: root ( one of the first ones to try out )

Submit root flag? Answer: cat flag.txt

### Fawn

Spawned the machine and got the ip. I already had vpn connection from previous assignment ( and connection open elsewhere also, still need to be careful ) First some easy common knowledge questions 

What does the 3-letter acronym FTP stand for? A: file transfer protocol
Which port does the FTP service listen on usually? A: 21
What acronym is used for the secure version of FTP? A:sftp ( SSH File Transfer Protocol / secure file transfer protocol )
What is the command we can use to send an ICMP echo request to test our connection to the target? A: ping

For the next one needed to show some effort. In nmap -A the -A flag means enabled OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute ( source: man nmap )

![fawn](https://github.com/t-t-r/Penetration-testing-course-2023/blob/main/img/fawn2.jpg)

From your scans, what version is FTP running on the target? A: vsftpd 3.0.3
From your scans, what OS type is running on the target? A: unix ( OS is visible in the the same screenshot )
What is the command we need to run in order to display the 'ftp' client help menu? A: ftp -h
What is username that is used over FTP when you want to log in without having an account? A: anonymous
(source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.applicationhost/sites/site/ftpserver/security/authentication/anonymousauthentication)

What is the response code we get for the FTP message 'Login successful'? 

For this connected with ftp to see what the code was. -Port selects the port we want to connect, might be needed if it was running in some unusual port number. Anyway: from the succesful connection, i saw that the answer was 230.

Last two are trivial once again.
There are a couple of commands we can use to list the files and directories available on the FTP server. One is dir. What is the other that is a common way to list files on a Linux system. A:ls
What is the command used to download the file we found on the FTP server? A: get
And finally to get the root flag, use get flag.txt to transfer the file to kali. then cat flag.txt to complete the HTB machine.
